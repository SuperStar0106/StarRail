# Application Configuration

Starting with version 0.8.0, Starward no longer uses the registry to store configuration, but instead uses file and database, making it easier to migrate the overall application between devices. However, the registry will still be used when the file structure does not meet the following conditions:

```
│ config.ini
│ starward.exe
│ version.ini
│
└─ app-0.8.0
   │ Starward.exe
   ...
```

Don't worry, files downloaded from GitHub Release will definitely satisfy this condition, only when you pull the code and debug it locally will you use the registry to store the configuration.

## config.ini

The `config.ini` file contains only two setting items:

```ini
# Whether to enable console output logging, True/False
EnableConsole=False
# The location of the user folder
UserDataFolder=.
```

`UserDataFolder` is the folder of the user's data. If this value does not exist or the set folder does not exist, the application displays the welcome page at startup. If `UserDataFolder` is set to the folder itself or a subfolder where the `config.ini` file is located, you can use **relative paths**, e.g. one of the dots `.` represents the current folder. In other cases, you **must** use an absolute path. In addition, both slash `/` and backslash `\` can be used.

Note: The `config.ini` file must be at the application root folder.

## Database

All setting items except for the two above are stored in the database `StarwardDatabase.db` in the user data folder. This file is a SQLite database, which you can edit with [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) or other software.

There is a table named `Setting` in the database that holds the application's setting items, and it has the following structure, with the keys and values represented as text.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Setting
(
    Key TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY.
    Value TEXT
).
```

There are two types of setting items within the application, static setting items using Pascal nomenclature `ASettingKey`, and dynamic setting items using Pascal nomenclature `a_setting_key`, which represent the existence of a corresponding value for each game region.

## Game Regions

Starward uses `enum GameBiz` to define different game regions, where the full name of the game such as `StarRail` will be specified in the comments when used.

## Static Settings

The data type `Type` in the following table uses the expression in C#, and `-` represents the default value of this type.

Dynamic setting items have different values in each game region, and their setting keys will have the game region appended to the end, for example, the setting item `custom_bg`, whose key of Genshin Impact (Global) is `custom_gb_hk4e_global`.
